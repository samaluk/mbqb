# AGENTS.md

## Next.js agent rules

The version-matched Next.js agent-rules block lives in `apps/web/AGENTS.md`,
next to the `next` package it references (`node_modules/next/dist/docs/` does not
resolve from the repo root in this monorepo). `next dev` writes and refreshes
that block, so run `pnpm dev` once after a Next.js upgrade to update it. Read
`apps/web/AGENTS.md` before writing code in `apps/web`.
