# Community Platform

The public digital home and content management system for community organizations to share places, publish educational guides, showcase products, and verify memberships with privacy preservation.

## Language

**Community Platform**:
The generic open-source web application and CMS enabling community organizations to share places, publish educational articles, catalog products, and verify memberships.
_Avoid_: MBQB, portal, bespoke website

**Operator**:
An organization, club, or community running an instance of the community platform with their own branding, configuration, and content.
_Avoid_: Tenant, client, account holder

**Membership**:
A staff-managed status indicating that the community considers an individual an active member, maintained indefinitely until staff updates or deactivates it.
_Avoid_: Account, user profile, subscription, validation

**Member Identifier**:
A normalized identifier (such as an email address, national ID, or member number) used by staff to record membership and by members to check active status.
_Avoid_: Username, credential, password

**Membership Verification**:
The public privacy-preserving tool that checks whether a member identifier has an active community membership status without exposing identity or roster data.
_Avoid_: Bogeyficador, identity verifier, payment checker, public member directory, auth check

**Place**:
A physical location, facility, venue, or point of interest curated by the community for members and visitors.
_Avoid_: Cancha, golf course, simulator, establishment

**Place Browsing**:
The public experience for finding Places through location, proximity, access type, text search, and map/table/list views.
_Avoid_: Cancha browsing, course database admin, directory admin, generic search page

**Access Type**:
The admission policy of a Place (`open`, `private`, `restricted`) describing who can access the venue.
_Avoid_: Pay and play, membership tier, permission

**Articles**:
The community platform's educational content hub and knowledge base for guides, tutorials, and community resources.
_Avoid_: La Biblia, news, blog, opinion feed

**Product**:
A community merchandise item or offering showcased for visitor inquiry or external purchase through a contact flow.
_Avoid_: Cart item, checkout item, SKU

**Public Content Publishing**:
The shared CMS publishing behavior for public Place, Article, and Product content: draft previews, staff-only editing, published public reads, and public route revalidation.
_Avoid_: Generic CMS plumbing, private membership validation

**Site Settings**:
The global CMS configuration controlling community brand identity, description, default locale, HTML language code, and identifier format across the application.
_Avoid_: Hardcoded config, theme file, environment branding

## Architectural Boundaries

**Core Platform vs. Operator Boundary**:
The core platform codebase contains generic data models, routes, UI components, and workflows. Operator-specific identity (brand name, description, locale, social links, member identifier format) is supplied via the Site Settings global and database content, never hardcoded in core source files.

**Privacy & Verification Boundary**:
The public verification endpoint checks membership status solely via a keyed HMAC-SHA256 hash of the normalized member identifier using the server's secret. Raw identifiers and member details are restricted to staff roles (`admin`, `validation-manager`) and are never exposed over public APIs or client bundles.

**Public Content vs. Administrative Boundary**:
Public visitors interact with cached read-only routes (`/`, `/places`, `/articles`, `/products`, `/verify`, `/privacy`). Administrative workflows and draft previews are isolated under `/admin` and protected by role-based access control (`admin`, `editor`, `validation-manager`).
